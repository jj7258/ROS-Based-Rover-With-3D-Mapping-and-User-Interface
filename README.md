# ROS Based Rover with 3D Mapping and User Interface

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GNU%20GPL%20v3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

Welcome to the **ROS Based Rover with 3D Mapping and User Interface** repository! This project combines the power of Robot Operating System (ROS), Kinect Sensor V1 to create a rover capable of producing a 3D Map of it's surroundings.
## Overview

This repository houses the source code and documentation for a rover that leverages the ROS framework for seamless communication between various components. The integration of 3D mapping enhances the rover's spatial awareness, while the user interface facilitates easy control of the rover.

## Features

- **ROS Integration**: Built on the Robot Operating System, ensuring modular and scalable architecture.
  
- **3D Mapping**: Utilizes RTAB-Map package to provide a comprehensive 3D representation of the rover's environment.

- **User Interface**: A user-friendly interface for remote control using React

- **Extensibility**: Easily expand and customize the rover's capabilities by integrating additional sensors or modules.
